# upper case, etc.  However, the name will be advertised as the email
# address (e.g., in subscribe confirmation notices), so it should not be
# otherwise altered.  (Email addresses are not case sensitive, but they
# are sensitive to almost everything else :-)

# parameters of this mailing list.  They are able to change any list
# configuration variable available through these administration web
# pages.
# 
# The list moderators have more limited permissions; they are not able
# to change any list configuration variable, but they are allowed to
# tend to pending administration requests, including approving or
# rejecting held subscription requests, and disposing of held postings.
# Of course, the list administrators can also tend to pending requests.
# 
# In order to split the list ownership duties into administrators and
# moderators, you must set a separate moderator password, and also
# provide the email addresses of the list moderators.  Note that the
# field you are changing here specifies the list administrators.

# to Never to disable prefix encoding.  This can make the subject
# headers slightly more readable for users with mail readers that don't
# properly handle non-ASCII encodings.
# 
# Note however, that if your mailing list receives both encoded and
# unencoded subject headers, you might want to choose As needed.  Using
# this setting, Mailman will not encode ASCII prefixes when the rest of
# the header contains only ASCII characters, but if the original header
# contains non-ASCII characters, it will encode the prefix.  This avoids
# an ambiguity in the standards which could cause some mail readers to
# display extra, or missing spaces between the prefix and the original

# still catches all such spams.
# 
# The cost is that the list will not accept unhindered any postings
# relayed from other addresses, unless
# 
# 
# The relaying address has the same name, or
# 
# The relaying address name is included on the options that specifies

# 
# For backwards compatibility with Mailman 1.1, if the regexp does not

## Bounce options
#
# These policies control the automatic bounce processing system in
# Mailman.  Here's an overview of how it works.
# 
# <p>When a bounce is received, Mailman tries to extract two pieces of
# information from the message: the address of the member the message
# was intended for, and the severity of the problem causing the bounce.
# The severity can be either <em>hard</em> or <em>soft</em> meaning
# either a fatal error occurred, or a transient error occurred.  When in
# doubt, a hard severity is used.
# 
# <p>If no member address can be extracted from the bounce, then the
# bounce is usually discarded.  Otherwise, each member is assigned a
# <em>bounce score</em> and every time we encounter a bounce from this
# member we increment the score.  Hard bounces increment by 1 while soft
# bounces increment by 0.5.  We only increment the bounce score once per
# day, so even if we receive ten hard bounces from a member per day,
# their score will increase by only 1 for that day.
# 
# <p>When a member's bounce score is greater than the <a
# href="?VARHELP=bounce/bounce_score_threshold">bounce score
# threshold</a>, the subscription is disabled.  Once disabled, the
# member will not receive any postings from the list until their
# membership is explicitly re-enabled (either by the list administrator
# or the user).  However, they will receive occasional reminders that
# their membership has been disabled, and these reminders will include
# information about how to re-enable their membership.
# 
# <p>You can control both the <a
# href="?VARHELP=bounce/bounce_you_are_disabled_warnings">number of
# reminders</a> the member will receive and the <a
# href="?VARHELP=bounce/bounce_you_are_disabled_warnings_interval"
# >frequency</a> with which these reminders are sent.
# 
# <p>There is one other important configuration variable; after a
# certain period of time -- during which no bounces from the member are
# received -- the bounce information is <a
# href="?VARHELP=bounce/bounce_info_stale_after">considered stale</a>
# and discarded.  Thus by adjusting this value, and the score threshold,
# you can control how quickly bouncing members are disabled.  You should
# tune both of these to the frequency and traffic volume of your list.

# By setting this value to No, you disable all automatic bounce
# processing for this list, however bounce messages will still be
# discarded so that the list administrator isn't inundated with them.
#
# legal values are:
#    0 = "No"
#    1 = "Yes"
bounce_processing = True

# Each subscriber is assigned a bounce score, as a floating point
# number.  Whenever Mailman receives a bounce from a list member, that
# member's score is incremented.  Hard bounces (fatal errors) increase
# the score by 1, while soft bounces (temporary errors) increase the
# score by 0.5.  Only one bounce per day counts against a member's
# score, so even if 10 bounces are received for a member on the same
# day, their score will increase by just 1.
# 
# This variable describes the upper limit for a member's bounce score,
# above which they are automatically disabled, but not removed from the
# mailing list.

# While Mailman's bounce detector is fairly robust, it's impossible to
# detect every bounce format in the world.  You should keep this
# variable set to Yes for two reasons: 1) If this really is a permanent
# bounce from one of your members, you should probably manually remove
# them from your list, and 2) you might want to send the message on to
# the Mailman developers so that this new format can be added to its
# known set.
# 
# If you really can't be bothered, then set this variable to No and all
# non-detected bounces will be discarded without further processing.
# 
# Note: This setting will also affect all messages sent to your list's
# -admin address.  This address is deprecated and should never be used,
# but some people may still send mail to this address.  If this happens,
# and this variable is set to No those messages too will get discarded.

# not moderated, set this option to None.
# 
# If the newsgroup is moderated, you can set this mailing list up to be
# the moderation address for the newsgroup.  By selecting Moderated, an
# additional posting hold will be placed in the approval process.  All
# messages posted to the mailing list will have to be approved before
# being sent on to the newsgroup, or to the mailing list membership.
# 
# Note that if the message has an Approved header with the list's
# administrative password in it, this hold test will be bypassed,
# allowing privileged posters to send messages directly to the list and
# the newsgroup.
# 
# Finally, if the newsgroup is moderated, but you want to have an open
# posting policy anyway, you should select Open list, moderated group.

## Contentfilter options
#
# Policies concerning the content of list traffic.

# <p>Content filtering works like this: when a message is received by
# the list and you have enabled content filtering, the individual
# attachments are first compared to the <a
# href="?VARHELP=contentfilter/filter_mime_types">filter types</a>.  If
# the attachment type matches an entry in the filter types, it is
# discarded.
# 
# <p>Then, if there are <a
# href="?VARHELP=contentfilter/pass_mime_types">pass types</a> defined,
# any attachment type that does <em>not</em> match a pass type is also
# discarded.  If there are no pass types defined, this check is skipped.
# 
# <p>After this initial filtering, any <tt>multipart</tt> attachments
# that are empty are removed.  If the outer message is left empty after
# this filtering, then the whole message is discarded.
# 
# <p> Then, each <tt>multipart/alternative</tt> section will be replaced
# by just the first alternative that is non-empty after filtering if <a
# href="?VARHELP=contentfilter/collapse_alternatives"
# >collapse_alternatives</a> is enabled.
# 
# <p>Finally, any <tt>text/html</tt> parts that are left in the message
# may be converted to <tt>text/plain</tt> if <a

# When messages are discarded, a log entry is written containing the
# Message-ID of the discarded message.  When messages are rejected or
# forwarded to the list owner, a reason for the rejection is included in
